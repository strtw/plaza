Accept / Block / Mute Flow
- When a user adds you to one of their circles, or manually selects you to share their updates, you are prompted to accept or block. If you accept you will see their updates, if you block you won't see them. They won't have any idea if you accept or block. There should be a little note that says something like "You can mute them or block them later if you change your mind"
